# Wait until ready flask api

Reference for when I want to make an app that needs to wait until an api is ready

Flask can only run one request at a time and therefore it is necessary for the client to ping it for a ready status

I made this repo so that I could easily get started on any app that needed to use flask and needed to determine a ready status
